# Shopping Cart App (Angular)

## Description  
This is a shopping cart module of a web application, built using **Angular**. It implements core cart functionalities — adding/removing items, updating quantities, and maintaining the cart state — all managed via Angular services and reactive components.

## Features  
- Add items to cart  
- Remove items from cart  
- Update item quantity  
- Persist cart state across components  
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes  

## Tech Stack  
- Angular  
- TypeScript  
- JavaScript  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## Installation / Running the App  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/purisha/-cart.git
cd -cart
npm install
ng serve
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200.

Note :This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

Usage

Once the app is running:
	1.	Navigate to the cart section
	2.	Add or remove products
	3.	Change quantities — the cart will update dynamically
	4.	Data is stored in a service, so you can maintain the cart state while navigating

Future Improvements
	•	Integrate with backend API to fetch real product data
	•	Persist cart in local storage or database
	•	Add checkout flow (payment, address form, order summary)
	•	Improve UX with animation (e.g., cart slide-in, quantity change feedback)


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
